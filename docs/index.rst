About
-----

Panhandler is a tool to manage and share PAN-OS configuration sets called `Skillets`.
A configuration set can be a full device configuration, or a set of configuration elements.
Panhandler allows you to import git repositories that contain
one or more configuration templates. Each template contains a set of configuration elements and variables that can
be customized for each deployment. Variables are presented in an auto-generated web form for an operator to complete.
Once complete, the template is rendered and pushed to a PAN-OS device.

For more information about Skillets, see the
`Live community page <https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Skillets/ct-p/Skillets>`_.
